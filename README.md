# sha256vhdl

This repository aims to implement the SHA-256 hash algorithm on dedicated FPGA harware, with the usage of VHDL.
A C++ implementation is also provided, to be a starting point as well as a comparison.

## Repository Structure

The folder structure is the following:
- *cpp/*: folder containing the C++ implementation
- *sha256vhdl.srcs/*: folder containing the vhdl implementation
- *presentation_pictures/*: here are the located the pitcures used in the report
- *links.txt*: a text file containing the links I consulted to document myself on the SHA256 implementation and the bitcoin protocol
- *SHA-256.pdf*: a document containing the SHA256 specification I followed
- *sha256vhdl - alex pegoraro.pdf*: The project report
- *sha256vhdl.pptx*: The presentation of the project
